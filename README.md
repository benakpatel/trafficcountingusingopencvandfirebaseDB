# trafficcountingusingopencvandfirebaseDB
In this project traffic vehicle count is calculated with the help of opencv and the data consisting of Rightlane and leftlane is uploaded on to firebase and same is reflected in the mit android app[but few minor changes are required as .json format assigns RHlane and LHlane values to some random values]
